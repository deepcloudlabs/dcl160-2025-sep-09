my_dears = ["Werner", "Alex", "Anne-Flore", "Irene", "Alex"]

# write the relevant Python code to sort the content in reverse-alphabetical order without creating another data structure

# write the relevant Python code to look for ‘Werner’ value index

# Define a strategy and write the Python code to cast my_dears list into a new data structure named unique_dears that only consists of unique values
# list -> list/unique

# write the relevant Python code in order to get the following result from the data structure unique_dears :
# [(0, 'Anne-Flore'), (1, 'Werner'), (2, 'Irene'), (3, 'Alex')]
