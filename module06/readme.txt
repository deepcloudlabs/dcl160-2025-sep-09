I. imperative programming: structured programming, procedural programming, oop
problem -> algorithm -> code -> solution

II. declarative programming: functional programming
problem -> describe solution -> code

    pipeline -> chain of functions: filter, map, reduce, flatMap, ...
    I. Higher-Order Functions: functions that take functions as arguments
    II. Pure Functions: functions that return the same result if given the same arguments
